# Red-vs-Blue-Project
In this project I played the role of a pentester and a SOC Analyst.

I went into our Elk Stack and set up the Filebeat, Metricbeat, and Packetbeat to capture all the traffic.

Then I played as the Pentester to crack into this company's server using a plethora of different methods to find hidden folders and Usernames and Passwords.

Once we finished there and found the flag, then I buckled down and turned into the blue team to Analyze and collect all the data collected from the logs.

After gathering all the reports i needed together, i placed them all together in a nice Slideshow presentation to show all the data collected and to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that i was successfully able to preform.
