# Red-vs-Blue-Project
In this project I played the role of a pentester and a SOC Analyst.

I went into our Elk Stack and set up the Filebeat, Metricbeat, and Packetbeat to capture all the traffic.

As the Red Team I used tools such as Nmap, Nessus, and Metasploit to gain access to a vulnerable target. Cracking into this company's server using these tools to find hidden folders and Usernames and Passwords.

Switching to the Blue Team I used the Kibana dashboard to analyze the data collected from the three active beats (Filebeat, Metricbeat, and Packetbeat). I buckled down to analyze and collect all the data collected from the logs.

After gathering all the reports i needed together, i placed them all together in a nice Slideshow presentation to show all the data collected and to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that i was successfully able to preform.
